sample-175809.mp3,thank you said the boy
sample-043243.mp3,it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand
sample-131335.mp3,the boy turned to the hand that wrote all
sample-127808.mp3,i don't know the desert that well yet
sample-013557.mp3,i just don't trust anyone who says they've never had hamburger helper
sample-101125.mp3,because i've always heard about them the boy answered saying nothing about his dream
sample-077937.mp3,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
sample-084512.mp3,the boy looked out at the horizon
sample-042637.mp3,other servants maintained the fires in the hookahs
sample-045193.mp3,it didn't bring with it the smell of the desert nor the threat of moorish invasion
sample-158536.mp3,he took back his books and packed them away again in their bags
sample-087107.mp3,he got up early with the idea of finding it
sample-053797.mp3,but the merchant understood what the boy had said
sample-162639.mp3,the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
sample-144103.mp3,three armed tribesmen approached and asked what the boy and the alchemist were doing there
sample-151927.mp3,he must know how to deal with the snakes of the desert
sample-105006.mp3,the dunes are changed by the wind but the desert never changes
sample-177797.mp3,a large piece suddenly came off and fell with a loud and sharp noise
sample-017921.mp3,most meteorites are more or less rounded
sample-084651.mp3,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
sample-060888.mp3,first they tried to find him on their own
sample-036055.mp3,and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
sample-013150.mp3,it's what you have always wanted to accomplish
sample-119663.mp3,maybe no one here knows what an alchemist is
sample-124123.mp3,everything in life is an omen said the englishman now closing the journal he was reading
sample-178262.mp3,the caravan moved toward the east
sample-005811.mp3,in alchemy it's called the soul of the world
sample-175999.mp3,everyone seemed very excited
sample-095923.mp3,the streamer of gas came out towards us
sample-043952.mp3,the alchemist knocked on the gate of the monastery
sample-156729.mp3,the boy awoke before dawn
sample-125124.mp3,during the third year the omens will continue to speak of your treasure and your destiny
sample-062159.mp3,i have already found my treasure
sample-015476.mp3,it turned out to be a bitter tea
sample-022588.mp3,then he turned to the boy this time his expression was cold and distant
sample-040081.mp3,strange images passed through my mind
sample-045710.mp3,i don't know how to turn them into reality
sample-156724.mp3,looking through the telescope i saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet
sample-035695.mp3,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-168125.mp3,but in his heart he knew that it did matter
sample-099576.mp3,the boy said nothing
sample-156090.mp3,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
sample-169344.mp3,he wanted to say so to the alchemist but he was afraid of the man
sample-146006.mp3,no one seemed to have thought about it that night
sample-062612.mp3,in any case it's good that you've learned that everything in life has its price
sample-113037.mp3,the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
sample-162475.mp3,there was no need to imprison them the arabs simply confiscated their horses
sample-158415.mp3,scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking
sample-066604.mp3,but the englishman appeared not to attach any importance to it
sample-076511.mp3,another pause and he broke out again like one demented
sample-110696.mp3,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
sample-027840.mp3,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
sample-015527.mp3,i'm already used to the way things are
sample-027742.mp3,his life and his path had always provided him with enough omens
sample-150080.mp3,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
sample-011187.mp3,it was starlight and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her
sample-024536.mp3,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
sample-168736.mp3,i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-052593.mp3,somebody pushed against me and i almost fell into the ditch
sample-118911.mp3,george's hill and the woods of painshill
sample-037579.mp3,it's extremely suspicious that there's no information about brains that didn't come from a brain
sample-181165.mp3,you can't believe it's not butter
sample-156515.mp3,you wanna take this outside
sample-117789.mp3,i do not know how far my experience is common
sample-022840.mp3,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
sample-080898.mp3,if you start your emails with greetings let me be the first to welcome you to earth
sample-192710.mp3,some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
sample-153783.mp3,the boy smiled and continued digging
sample-156489.mp3,but they were not there
sample-066835.mp3,my review of the sun one star
sample-099939.mp3,if you start your emails with greetings let me be the first to welcome you to earth
sample-081250.mp3,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
sample-112441.mp3,some went away while i was there and other people came
sample-126947.mp3,the top had certainly ceased to rotate
sample-025506.mp3,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
sample-014224.mp3,and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
sample-134048.mp3,looking through the telescope i saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet
sample-042006.mp3,i heard a faint movement under my feet
sample-019125.mp3,coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music
sample-009916.mp3,from the railway station in the distance came the sound of trains ringing and rumbling
